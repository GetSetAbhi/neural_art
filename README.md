# neural_art

This repository contains (TensorFlow and Keras) code that transfers the 
style of a given image to another. The code has been written using [this][original] and [this][youtube]as a guide

Following are the input and the reference image that I have used.

<img src="/logan.jpg" width="256" height="256">
<img src="/styles/block.jpg" width="256" height="256">


## Run

To run the script just open the terminal and change directory to
this repository.
Run this python file **art_generator.py**


## Remarks

The code runs in 10 iterations.
After every iteration an Image is generated and saved in the output folder.
Every iteration takes upto 20 mins since its working on a **CPU** and not **GPU**.
So if you have NVIDIA GPU on your machine then it is recommended that you use 
Tensorflow with GPU support for faster execution.
